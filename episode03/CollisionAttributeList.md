 List by LilyLambda & PhazoGanon
 Collision Attributes with "📝" require more testing. If anyone wants to help, there's comments in this doc that will have general and per-move instructions.

If it's similar to another hit effect, mention how it differs. Remains in here until WuBoy's script dump stops using the hash. -->
- **collision_attr_bind** = Inflicts the dizzy status (eg. shield breaks). Only works on ground.

- **collision_attr_deathball** = 📝 An effect similar to the instant KO effect that's used on Whack/Thwack, always instakills when applied to other hitboxes, likely due to not being able to call to a Hero-specific function to determine when it'll KO. <!-- Find the alleged Hero-specific function and, if possible, find a way to port it to other characters. -->

<!-- crush = In PhazoGanon's words: "Apparently there's also an effect called crush. Which happens on stages like Midgar and Distant Planet. And it's also an instant KO". Figure out if this exists, dump some scripts that use it. Unsure if 0x145f286b64/collision_attr_crush exists or if the attribute uses an alternate name. Midgar's crush is probably the stage coming together to kill the player, and for Distant Planet, the Bulborb closing its mouth. Unsure is this is just death or not, would have to look into stage hitboxes. -->

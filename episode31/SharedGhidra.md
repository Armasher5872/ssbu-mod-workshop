## Accessing the Shared Ghidra Server
##### Big thanks to Coolsonickirby for this guide!

1. Make a new ghidra project like normal (non-shared, pick a location and name, etc...)
2. Once you do that, click `Project > View Repository > Ghidra Server`
3. `Server Name`: `ghidra.arcropolis.com`
4. `Port Number`: `37500`
    - Server Name and Port Number are subject to change. If they do, [csk's ghidra setup guide](https://coolsonickirby.github.io/Smash-Ultimate-Documentation/Reverse%20Engineering/Ghidra/) will have accurate information in it
5. Click the blue "refresh" icon
6. Log in Anonymously (if prompted)
7. Pick `SmushLoaderino`
8. Drag everything you want locally from the right side (the repo) to the left side (your local project)
9. Wait for a bit (basically downloading the stuff you picked from the repo locally)
10. Profit 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
